# WinShell Project Landing Site

An immersive, neon-inspired landing experience for the WinShell university capstone. The site pairs a WebGL shader backdrop with glassmorphism download cards and a scrollable PDF viewer so visitors can explore the full project report without leaving the page.

Built with the Next.js App Router, Tailwind CSS v4 tokens, shadcn/ui primitives, and the latest React 19 runtime.

## ✨ Highlights

- **Animated shader canvas** using Three.js and a custom GLSL fragment shader for a shimmering, aurora-like background.
- **Glassmorphism download cards** with pointer-tracked glows, platform-specific copy, and hover/touch feedback.
- **Embedded project report** powered by `react-pdf` with adaptive sizing, snap scrolling, and graceful loading/error states.
- **Responsive & accessible layout** tuned for desktop touchpads and mobile gestures, with motion and background layers optimized for readability.
- **Production-ready metadata** including favicons, social previews, and a PWA manifest generated under `public/`.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- [Next.js 15 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) with React 19
- [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) with custom design tokens
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for the animated shader banner
- [react-pdf](https://github.com/wojtekmaj/react-pdf) + `pdfjs-dist` CDN worker for document rendering
- [framer-motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for entrance and hover animations
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) primitives and utility helpers (`clsx`, `tailwind-merge`)

## 🚀 Quick Start

Prerequisites: Node.js 18.18+ (or any runtime supported by Next.js 15) and npm.

```powershell
# install dependencies
npm install

# start the local dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev
```

For production builds:

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
```

## 📂 Key Scripts

| Script | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Launches the Turbopack-powered development server with fast refresh. |
| `npm run build` | Produces an optimized production build using Turbopack. |
| `npm start` | Serves the production build. |
| `npm run lint` | Runs ESLint with the Next.js config. |

## 🗂️ Content & Assets

- `public/downloads/` holds the platform installers linked from the landing page cards. Replace the placeholder `.exe` and `.deb` files with real artifacts to ship.
- `public/docs/winshell-report.pdf` is the embedded project report consumed by the PDF viewer.
- `public/og/`, `public/favicon.svg`, `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, and `public/site.webmanifest` were generated by `scripts/generate-branding.js` and power rich previews across devices.
- `src/components/` contains reusable UI primitives, including the shader canvas (`shader-animation.tsx`), download card (`download-card.tsx`), and PDF viewer (`pdf-scroll-viewer.tsx`).

## 🛠️ Customization Notes

- **Shader tweaks**: Edit uniform values or the fragment shader inside `ShaderAnimation` to adjust motion speed, color stops, or luminosity.
- **Download cards**: Update the `downloadCards` array in `src/app/page.tsx` to add new platforms or adjust copy. Each entry supports custom accent colors defined in the component.
- **Report updates**: Swap in a new PDF by replacing the file under `public/docs/` while keeping the filename consistent, or update the `file` prop in `PdfScrollViewer`.
- **Branding**: Regenerate the icon suite by running `node scripts/generate-branding.js` after updating the inputs; the script writes optimized PNG/SVG assets and updates the manifest.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

- `npm run lint` ensures code quality with `eslint-config-next`.
- `npm run build` validates that the App Router bundle compiles successfully with the shader, PDF worker, and dynamic imports.
